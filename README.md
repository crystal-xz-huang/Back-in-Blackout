## Overview

This project aims to simulate satellite communications around Jupiter using a simplified file transfer protocol. The solution leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage complex geospatial interactions between satellites and devices.

## Objectives

1.  **Understanding the Problem Space**. Analyze and comprehend the complex geospatial and mathematical ideas involved in satellite communications.
2.  **Thoughtful Planning**. Model the domain by defining the entities present in the domain and their relationships. 
3.  **Programming by Contract**. The specification outlines everything you have to implement - youâ€™ll need to implement your solution according to the rules and test your solution to ensure correctness.
4.  **Robust Programming**. Maintaing ood quality programming practices including code style as well as the overall design in developing the system.
5.  **Building Blocks**. Develop skills in working with Java, the VSCode IDE.
